                    <p>A visionary scientist and space researcher dedicated to unlocking the mysteries of the cosmos.
                        Owen founded Futuristics with the mission of bridging the gap between current space exploration
                        capabilities and the technologies needed for humanity's expansion beyond Earth.</p><br><br>
                    <p>With expertise in astrophysics, planetary science, and advanced propulsion systems, Owen leads
                        our research into the practical aspects of interplanetary travel, resource extraction, and the
                        long-term sustainability of human presence in space.</p>

                <h2>Explore the Unknown</h2>
                <p>Space exploration is the journey beyond our world into the unknown, driven by discovery, innovation,
                    and
                    the desire to reach the stars. It is an adventure into infinity, where every step forward shapes the
                    future of humanity.</p>

                    <h3>Suns & Stars</h3>
                    <p>The Sun is a star, just like the ones we see at night, but it looks brighter because it’s the
                        closest to Earth at about 150 million kilometers away. Stars, including our Sun, are huge balls
                        of hot plasma powered by nuclear fusion, turning hydrogen into helium and releasing light and
                        heat. They come in many sizes and colors, with lifespans that can range from millions to
                        billions of years.</p>

                    <h3>Planets</h3>
                    <p>Planets are large bodies that orbit stars, and in our Solar System there are eight of them
                        revolving around the Sun. Unlike stars, planets do not produce their own light—they reflect the
                        Sun’s light. They come in two main types: rocky planets like Earth and Mars, and gas giants like
                        Jupiter and Saturn. Each planet has unique features, from rings and storms to mountains and
                        oceans, making them some of the most diverse objects in space.</p>

                    <h3>Galaxies</h3>
                    <p>Galaxies are vast collections of stars, planets, gas, dust, and dark matter held together by
                        gravity. Our home galaxy, the Milky Way, contains hundreds of billions of stars, and it’s just
                        one of trillions of galaxies in the universe. They come in different shapes—spiral, elliptical,
                        and irregular—and can span hundreds of thousands of light-years across.</p>

                    <h3>Travel Plans</h3>
                    <p>Futuristics is built on the dream of making space travel possible for everyone. Our vision is to
                        go beyond Earth and open the door to exploring the Moon, Mars, and even the outer planets. We
                        plan to design safe, advanced spacecraft that can carry people and resources into orbit and
                        beyond. Step by step, Futuristics aims to make living, working, and traveling in space an
                        achievable reality, not just science fiction.</p>
